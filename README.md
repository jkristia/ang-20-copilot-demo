# Angular 20 Copilot Demo

A comprehensive full-stack application showcasing what can be built entirely through AI-assisted development using GitHub Copilot (Claude Opus 4.5). This project demonstrates Angular 20, NestJS, real-time WebSocket synchronization, AG Grid data tables, and configuration management — all generated through iterative prompting.

> **Note:** The only file in this project NOT generated by AI/Copilot is [prompt.md](prompt.md), which contains the human-written prompts used to build everything else.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular 20 with Angular Material and AG Grid
- **Backend**: NestJS with file-based persistence (JSON/CSV)
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live synchronization across all connected clients
- **Data Grid**: AG Grid Community with virtual scrolling and inline editing
- **Shared**: Common TypeScript interfaces between frontend and backend

## Features

### Blog Posts
- View, create, and manage blog posts
- Real-time updates: changes made on one client automatically appear on all connected clients
- New posts are briefly highlighted when added

### Demo Config Page
- REST-managed configuration with real-time sync via WebSocket
- Multiple settings components: Display Settings, Network Settings
- Running State management with timed execution
- All fields respect enabled/disabled states and validation rules
- Collapsible sections for organized settings

### Employees Data Grid
- AG Grid with virtual scrolling for 1000+ records
- Tabbed views: Employees list and Employee Details at `/employees`
- Inline cell editing with validation
- Changes persisted to CSV and synced via WebSocket to all clients
- Reusable data grid component architecture

### General
- Responsive Material Design UI
- Typed WebSocket events with shared interfaces

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.19+ or v22.12+)
- npm
- Python 3.9+ (for mock data generation)

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

```bash
make install
```

### Run the application

Start the backend server (runs on http://localhost:3000):

```bash
make server
```

Start the frontend client in a separate terminal (runs on http://localhost:4200):

```bash
make client
```

## Available Commands

```bash
make               # Show available commands
make install       # Install dependencies for both server and client
make server        # Start the NestJS backend server (auto-generates mock data if missing)
make client        # Start the Angular frontend client
make generate-data # Regenerate all mock data files
make kill          # Kill server (port 3000) and client (port 4200) if running
make run-all       # Start client (background) and server (foreground)
```

## Swagger / OpenAPI

Swagger UI is available at http://localhost:3000/openapi when the server is running. An OpenAPI YAML file is also generated at [server/openapi.yaml](server/openapi.yaml), which you can inspect with Swagger Editor (https://editor.swagger.io) by importing the file. Note: OpenAPI schemas are generated from Swagger-decorated DTO classes; shared TypeScript interfaces are not reflected in the spec.
